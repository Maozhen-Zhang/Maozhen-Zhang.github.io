  abstract={An angular analysis of the rare decay \(B_s^0 \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-\) is presented,
            using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass 
            energies of \(7\), \(8\) and \(13~\mbox{TeV}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity 
            of \(8.4~\mbox{fb}^{âˆ’1}\). The observables describing the angular distributions of the 
            decay \(B_s^0 \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-\) are determined in regions of \(q^2\), the square of 
            the dimuon invariant mass. The results are consistent with Standard Model predictions.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a new chaotic system based on two parameters. The proposed chaotic system has good chaotic characteristics, and it can be shown that the chaotic system is suitable for image encryption through a variety of simulation experiments. Based on this system, we propose a new image encryption algorithm. The algorithm uses nonlinear chaotic sequences for row, column, and diagonal scrambling and diffusion in two directions. When scrambling, the diffusion matrix generated by the chaotic system is dynamically upset, and the image scrambling direction is determined by the relative coordinates of multiple chaotic systems. When diffusing, two matrices are used to change the pixel value: one is the matrix processed by scrambling, and the other is the matrix generated by the truth table. The resulting encrypted image is affected by both the chaotic system and the truth table rules. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the image encrypted by this algorithm has high security.},

  abstract={In this paper, a new scrambling algorithm is proposed to reduce the correlation between the image pixels in three directions. In this paper, this algorithm is called ladder scrambling, and the image is scrambled multiple times in the form of diagonal lines. In terms of diffusion, DNA coding is used, and the secondary processing of the image is performed through DNA coding to change the pixel value of the image. The final encrypted image is affected by three conditions: the number of scrambling algorithms, the selection of DNA coding rules, and the key of the chaotic system. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the algorithm is safe and effective.},

  abstract={An improved one-dimensional compound sine map is introduced. The evaluation of this chaotic system shows that it has high sensitivity and random chaotic behaviour. Based on this chaotic system, a new fast image encryption scheme is proposed. Through the cross-processing of multiple chaotic sequences, two high-sensitivity pseudo-random sequences are generated, and the generated high-sensitivity random sequence is used for synchronization cross-processing in four directions. Using the symmetry of the image, the image is divided into four directions, and the processing of each direction is different based on the high-sensitivity sequence and the chaotic value. Through one traversal, the entire image is processed four times differently. The encryption process is uncontrollable and invisible depending on the chaotic sequence. Simulation test results show that the algorithm has good encryption results, is sensitive to the initial secret key and provides satisfactory security capabilities compared with other algorithms.},
